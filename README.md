A Trick or Treat
By Nathaniel Burman


Idea:
This is a story idea that encompases the spirit that was previously contained in the classic Charles Dickens’ novel A Christmas Carol except that this story confronts depression in youth and some of the common problems that children have to deal with in this current American culture.  The classic Christmas Carol is a very interesting story that enchants the youth with its spirits and magic however, the main character is an old adult and the story mainly focuses on an adult with adult issues, a message the preaches that of a rich man that should give more of his earning to other people.  My story, A Trick or Treat, focuses on a child’s issues of growing up in our modern culture, and uses some magic and monsters to tell the story of having fun and letting go of one’s problems to at least enjoy a night of fun with your friends and your family.

---------------------


Introduction

The plot is that there is a youth (John) who does not engage in the Halloween spirit, he is depressed and wants to commit suicide. Yet, he is convinced by a religious ‘dead relative’, Elijah, that if he wants to be happier and live a more fruitful life that he should enjoy life at all of its morally equitable allowed moments, and that to truly be happy one must enjoy the act of giving and being a part of something larger than themselves.  Elijah tells him to go Trick or Treating and that upon his visit of three houses he will be met with three gods that will show him how to let go of his inhibitions.  The three gods that he will meet are Despair (Blue Devils), Happiness (Nanty Narking or Gigglemug), and Nihilism (Old Man Croaker). 

He wakes up from sleep suddenly. The youth decides he was just sleeping and the conversation with Elijah was in a dream. He textes his friend on his phone and leaves to go over to his house.  He walks down the sidewalk.  While walking down the sidewalk, people pass by in full halloween costume.  

Part I

Blue Devils begin to appear and start to make him scared.  Then in a spat of emotion he runs up to a house and bangs on the door frantically.  Despair opens the door.  Despair goes on to show him people who on Halloween are without any cheer in the world.  People who are without help and who receive no help from others.  Children who go without, and adults who live miserably.  The god then shows his life which is not that bad after all.  Despair opens the front door and John walks out it.  John notices that he is now just outside the house on the porch and that children and their parents walk the streets in costume.

Part II

John becomes spooked by the experience and decides to just go home.  Upon walking up to his house he notices that his house has been toilet papered.  And he sees the kids that are still actually TP’ing the house are there.  John runs up to the kids yelling at them but they just laugh and run away.  Pissed, he walks up to the house, opens the door and goes inside.

He quickly realizes that he is not inside of his house.  He looks around and then a Jovial adult walks up to him with a tray full of candy.  The god Gigglemug begins to show John how to have fun.  How many people have fun from children to adults.  How having fun makes people happy and helps to relieve stress and take people’s mind off of the things in life that are complicated and make them sad.

Part III

John walks out of the house and back onto the street when his phone receives a notification.  A picture of his best friend kissing his girlfriend.  He becomes ill-tempered and puts on a mask and grabs a baseball bat and decides to go over and confront them both at their house.

John finally comes up to the house and sees his girlfriend and his best friend sitting on a couch together watching a scary movie on the TV.  He walks up to the door and knocks on it and yells “trick or treat”! He sees in the window that his girlfriend and best friend get up out of the couch and walk over to the door.  The door opens and John becomes drenched in slime and oatmeal.

Nihilism stands at the door.  John swings his bat at him.  The bat breaks. Inside of the house it is dark and completely black.  There is nothing inside except for the demon-god Nihilism. 

[Something happens here to connect……]

John wakes up in his bed.  His phone alarm clock is ringing.  He sees that the date says that today is Halloween and that he still has a chance to enjoy the day.



Conclusion
John goes over to his best friends house and sees his girlfriend there, he opens up the door and goes inside.  They both begin to act squirrely when they see John and start to give him a line of bullshit. John just say’s calmly, “you both deserve each other”.  And he leaves the house.

He goes down the street the the house where he was shown by the god Despair that a person was very sad.  He knocks on the door and when the person answers the door, John gives them OBJECT.  They are happy now.

And he calls up his new best friend a (female girl who really likes him). And they both go out and trick or treat.
